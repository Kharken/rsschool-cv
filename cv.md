## About
___

My name is Yuriy. For over 13 years, I have worked in various branches of chemical technology. I recently made the decision to change my field of work, and I started studying to become a frontend developer from April 2024.

During my career in chemistry I have worked in different roles: development engineer, project manager, production manager and have gained skills in commercial development, project management, human resource management.

Now I'm determined to change my field to frontend development, and I'm sure that my previous experience along with various training programs will help me become a great programmer.

* **Task description**
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Your function only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.

* **My solution**
```Javascript
const summation = function (num) {
  let sum = 0
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++){
  sum += i
  };
  return sum;
```
